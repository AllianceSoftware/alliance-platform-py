Alliance Platform UI
=============================================

The UI package provides a convenient way to render components from the Alliance UI React library in Django templates.

It is an implementation of the :doc:`Frontend <alliance-platform-frontend:index>` package to specifically render
components from the Alliance UI React library.

Currently no settings are required for the UI package, although the frontend package will need to be appropriately
configured.
