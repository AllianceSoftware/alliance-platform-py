Legacy Migration
----------------

These instructions can be used to migrate a project using the legacy ``common_lib.server_choices`` package to ``alliance_platform.server_choices``.

The structure of the package has not been changed, so to migrate simply:

* Find and replace all imports from ``common_lib.server_choices`` to ``alliance_platform.server_choices``
