View Decorator
**************

If you have an existing django view that you want to render as a pdf, you can use the decorator:

.. code:: python

    from alliance_platform.pdf.decorators import view_as_pdf

    @view_as_pdf()
    def my_view(request):
        return HttpResponse('Some content')

Here, an existing function view is wrapped with the decorator. By default, the decorator will only render
the view as a pdf if it sees a query parameter called :code:`pdf=<value>`, and :code:`value` evaluates to true using :py:func:`~distutils.util.strtobool`,
e.g. http://foo/pdf-view?pdf=true.

You can easily override this behaviour by specifying your own query parameter name to look for:

.. code:: python

    @view_as_pdf(query_param_test='my-custom-parameter')
    def my_view(request):
        return HttpResponse('Some content')

Which will return a pdf if the request looks like http://foo/pdf-view?my-custom-parameter=true.

You also pass a custom function that takes the request and returns whether to render based on some other
condition:

.. code:: python

    @view_as_pdf(query_param_test=lambda r: r.META.get('X-Custom-Header'))
    def my_view(request):
        return HttpResponse('Some content')

When a page is rendered, it will usually initiate network requests for additional resources (images,
javascript files, ajax requests). These are usually handled directly by this app: static files and media
files are served directly from the filesystem, and Django requests are manually processed through the basic
Django stack (e.g. these requests don't trigger actual http requests to your webserver in order to avoid
potential deadlocks on a loaded web server).

For requests that are handled using the Django stack, unless explicitly controlled using the options
available (see :code:`request_headers`, :code:`extra_headers` below), every request generated by chromium
(and this includes the request for the initial page render view) will be supplied with headers extracted
from the incoming Django HttpRequest META dictionary (note that this includes more than
just the HTTP headers, e.g. ``SERVER_NAME``, ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``, the process env variables, etc).
Only those keys whose values have type ``str`` are extracted from META and set on the internal request
object. Importantly, the ``HTTP_COOKIE`` header will be passed through, which means the session (and therefore
logged-in user) will be preserved on these requests.

However, if you want your rendered pages to be allowed to fetch from arbitrary network locations, you can pass
the parameter :code:`pass_through=True` to the decorator. When this is :code:`True`, we will first attempt to handle
the request internally, and if that is not possible, we will allow chromium to handle the request as
normal (when this setting is :code:`False` - the default - we raise an exception for any un-handled requests).
Note that this is generally discouraged: slow network requests to other web servers may cause your PDF
generation to time out.

Here is an example that requires :code:`pass_through` in order to render an image from an external location:

.. code:: python

    @view_as_pdf(pass_through=True)
    def pdf_view(request):
        return HttpResponse(
            '<html><body><img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" /></body></html>')

Here is a more complex example, that renders a template view as a pdf, and overrides the url path that will be seen
by chromium when rendering that view (this allows you to specify the route that will be rendered by single
page apps for example):

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        url(
            'pdf-route',
            view_as_pdf(optional=False, url_path='/admin/users/')(
                django_site.views.FrontendView.as_view(
                    site=admin_site,
                    basename='admin',
                    entry_point='admin',
                )
            )
        ),
    ]

In the example above, we set :code:`optional=False` so that this view *always* renders as a pdf, and have used
the :code:`url_path` argument to make sure when the single-page-app renders, the url that it sees is :code:`/admin/users`,
which will trigger the rendering of a particular route when the javascript on the page is executed.

If you need to set extra headers on the requests that are triggered during rendering you can do
so with :code:`extra_headers`:

.. code:: python

    @view_as_pdf(extra_headers={'X-Custom-Header': 'something'})
    def pdf_view(request):
        return HttpResponse('content')

If you need to make sure only an explicit set of headers are present on these requests, use :code:`request_headers`:

.. code:: python

    @view_as_pdf(request_headers={'X-Custom-Header': 'something'})
    def pdf_view(request):
        return HttpResponse('content')

Manual Rendering
****************

 The other main function provided by this app allows rendering html directly to pdf:

.. code:: python

    from alliance_platform.pdf.render import render_pdf

    render_pdf(html='<html><body>Content here</body></html>', pass_through=True)

This function can render either the provided html (which can then trigger additional network requests which are
handled as above), or a provided url:

.. code:: python

    render_pdf(url='https://www.google.com', pass_through=True, request_handlers=[])

Here we make sure that there are no :code:`request_handlers` (see below), so that all requests are handled by chromium (since the source url
is external).

You can use this to render a PDF and then send it as an attachment:

.. code:: python

    pdf = render_pdf(
        request.build_absolute_uri(reverse("demo_app:restaurant_menu", kwargs={"pk": self.object.pk})),
        request_headers=extract_request_headers(request),
    )
    message = EmailMessage(
        f"Menu for {self.object.brand.name} {self.object.name}",
        "Here is the menu you requested",
        "demo@examplesystem.com",
        [email],
    )
    message.attach("menu.pdf", pdf, "application/pdf")
    message.send()

This example renders from a URL and passes the headers from the current request.

Request Handlers
****************

The network requests that are triggered during rendering are typically handled internally by this app (except when
:code:`pass_through` is set, as mentioned above). The code that is responsible for handling these requests is in
:code:`request_handlers`. By default, the following request handlers are used by :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.render.render_pdf`:

.. code:: python

    [
        StaticHttpRequestHandler(),
        MediaHttpRequestHandler(),
        DjangoRequestHandler(),
        # The default includes domains set in the `alliance_platform.pdf_WHITELIST_DOMAINS`
        # When DEBUG is enabled also includes the Vite dev server URL
        WhitelistDomainRequestHandler(whitelist_domains)
    ]


* :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.WhitelistDomainRequestHandler`: this handler allows any requests to the specified domains. This is useful for known external resources - eg. external CSS fonts, images loaded from S3 that sit outside the media directory etc.
* :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.StaticHttpRequestHandler`: serves Django static file assets through direct filesystem lookup
* :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.MediaHttpRequestHandler`: serves Django media file assets through direct filesystem lookup
* :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.DjangoRequestHandler`: processes any requests that are for the same url as the initial page url (the :code:`url`
  parameter to :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.render.render_pdf`) as Django requests (runs them through the Django stack).

Note that these handlers are attempted in the order provided, so order can be important.

When :code:`pass_through=True`, this is handled internally by adding a :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.PassThroughRequestHandler` to the list of handlers,
in the last position.

There is also a :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.CustomRequestHandler` available that can be used to return arbitrary responses to specific urls:

.. code:: python

    handler = CustomRequestHandler({
      'https://foo.com/bar': {
        'body': b'Some response content',
        'headers': {
            'X-Custom-Header': 'blah',
        }
      }
    })

Internally, when :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.render.render_pdf` is passed an :code:`html` argument, it handles this using :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.CustomRequestHandler`.

If you need to create your own request handler, be aware that since the pdf render script normally runs as a
sub-process, the base :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.RequestHandler` class contains methods for :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.RequestHandler.serialize` and :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.RequestHandler.deserialize`, which are used
when passing these handlers to the sub-process. See :class:`~alliance_platform.pdf.request_handlers.CustomRequestHandler` for how this is used.


General Notes
*************

Process model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default rendering mode is to run pyppeteer in a sub-process. Pyppeteer will by default install signal handlers
to clean up chromium processes, and therefore expects to run in the main thread. Since all the request handling
is done in the sub-process, request handlers are serialized in the calling process and de-serialized in the
sub-process. So be aware that if you create your own request handler sub-class, it will execute in a different
environment (different process, different python interpreter) to the calling environment; in particular, global
variables will generally not be available.

A second rendering mode exists for some advanced use-cases, where the pyppeteer render script is run in the calling
process (the :code:`run_as_subproccess` argument to :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.render.render_pdf` controls this).
This mode is currently only used to enable testing, and you probably shouldn't be using it in normal use, unless you know what you are doing.

Knowing when the rendered page is 'finished'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pdf render script is configured by default to consider a page 'finished' when two conditions are met:

* when there are no more than 0 network connections for at least 500 ms
* and ``window.__PAGE_RENDERING_FINISHED`` is truthy (see `pageRenderingObserver.ts <https://github.com/AllianceSoftware/alliance-platform-js/blob/main/frontend/src/core/pageRenderingObserver.ts>`_)

For this second condition, it will wait (by default) up to 10 seconds for this to become true. After that
time (if the condition is not met) it will continue to render to PDF regardless.

You have some options in :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.decorators.view_as_pdf` and :meth:`~alliance_platform.pdf.render.render_pdf`
for controlling this second condition:

* turn it off: ``page_done_flag=None``
* change it to some other variable: ``page_done_flag="window.MY_FLAG"``
* change it to an arbitrary JS expression: ``page_done_flag="window.MY_FLAG === 4.5"``
* change the maximum time spent waiting on this flag: ``page_done_timeout_msecs=2000`` (wait up to 2 seconds)
