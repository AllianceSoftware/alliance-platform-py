Alliance Platform Frontend
=============================================

The frontend package provides a number of tools to help you build a frontend for your Django project. It includes:

* Integration with bundlers (currently just Vite) to make embedding assets in your Django templates easy.
* The :ttag:`component` template tag to make it easy to include React components in your templates.
* The :ttag:`stylesheet` template tag to make it easy to include CSS generated by Vanilla Extract in your templates.

To make these work there is some corresponding infrastructure required on the frontend side. This is currently
supplied in the ``template-dango`` repository, but will be split out into a published package at some point. Specifically
this provides

* A Vite dev server that provides some extra endpoints to support the Django integration, including SSR in development.
* A ``renderComponent.tsx`` file used by the :ttag:`component` template tag to render components.
* A build script that extracts the required assets to build from django using a management command.
* Some code to handle the SSR of components, including a minimal production SSR server to be run with ``node``.

The :doc:`Codegen <alliance-platform-codegen:index>` package is used to generate javascript code snippets that are
embedded in the template with the :ttag:`component` tag.
