class FrontendAssetRegistry:
    """Stores any extra assets in addition to those found in templates that should be included in the frontend build

    This should be populated on startup such that the assets are available when
    :class:`extract_frontend_assets <alliance_platform.frontend.management.commands.extract_frontend_assets.Command>` runs.

    In most cases only a single registry is required. :data:`~alliance_platform.frontend.bundler.asset_registry.frontend_asset_registry`
    is the default used throughout the site.

    .. warning::

        In most cases you do not need this.

        This is necessary only for assets that can't be auto-discovered - for example in a dynamic template. If you try
        and use an asset that cannot be auto-discovered an error will be raised.

    Usage::

        from alliance_platform.frontend.bundler.asset_registry import frontend_asset_registry

        frontend_asset_registry.add_asset(
            settings.PROJECT_DIR / "frontend/src/file1.tsx",
