Alliance Platform Server choices
===========================================================

This package adds a decorator which can be used to expose API endpoints to easily look up field choices. This is useful
when embedding the choices statically in the HTML is not desirable, for example when the number of options is larage.
It handles permission checks, allows for various customisations including filtering & ordering of choices, and combined with
@alliancesoftware/ui makes frontend integration easy.
