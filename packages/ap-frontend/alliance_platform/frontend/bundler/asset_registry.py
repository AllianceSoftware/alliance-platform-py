class FrontendAssetRegistry:
    """Stores any extra assets in addition to those found in templates that should be included in the frontend build

    This should be populated on startup such that the assets are available when
    :class:`extract_frontend_assets <alliance_platform.frontend.management.commands.extract_frontend_assets.Command>` runs.

    The registry to use is specified by the  :data:`~alliance_platform.frontend.settings.AlliancePlatformFrontendSettingsType.FRONTEND_ASSET_REGISTRY`
    setting.

    These assets are only used when building the frontend in dev. In production, the underlying assets do not need to exist -
    for example if your deployment process excludes the source files.

    .. warning::

        In most cases you do not need this.

        This is necessary only for assets that can't be auto-discovered - for example in a dynamic template. If you try
        and use an asset that cannot be auto-discovered an error will be raised.

    Usage::

        frontend_asset_registry = FrontendAssetRegistry()

        frontend_asset_registry.add_asset(
            settings.PROJECT_DIR / "frontend/src/file1.tsx",
